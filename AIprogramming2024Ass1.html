<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In this first exercise you are asked to implement an environment simulator for a variant of the well known Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) problem. Then, you will implement some agents that live in the environment and evaluate their performance.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the MAPD problem, a team of robots needs to pick up and deliver a set of packages. Each package has a pickup location, and a delivery location.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The robots need to visit all pickup locations to pick up the packages, and then all the delivery locations to deliver the packages.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This problem is repeatedly solved and implemented nowadays in automated warehouses, such as some operated by Amazon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A standard simplification is representing locations by graph nodes, and possible robot trajecteories between them by edges. In particular, in many implementations, as in this assignment, </span><span class="s2">a 2D grid-shaped graph</span><span class="s1"> is assumed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Some of the grid edges may be blocked, either permenently or temporarily, known in advance in this assignment Initial robot locations are knowm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Packages to be delivered may appear <b>at any time</b>, with </span><span class="s2">origin and delivery locations known in advance in this assignment</span><span class="s1">.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">All the above is given in the input in a format specified below. The problem is to pick up and deliver all the packages as quickly as possible. This is equivalent to finding an appropriate shortest path in a graph. However, unlike standard shortest path problems in graphs, which have easy known efficient solution methods (e.g. the Dijkstra algorithm), here the problem is that there is more than 1 vertex to visit, and their order is not given.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>MAPD problem environment</b></span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The environment consists of an undirected graph with the general shape of a grid, i.e. vertice at integer locations (i,j) ranging from (0,0) to (X,Y) inclusive, with X and Y specified in the input.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">There are edges along the x and y axes between every pair of neighboring vertices in the x and y directions. However, some of these edges, as specified in the input, are initially blocked.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A robot agent (pickup and delivery robot) at a vertex automatically picks up a package at that vertex if there is one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A picked up package stays with the robot until the robot reaches the package's delivery location, upon which the packege is automatically delivered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Some unblocked edges, specified in the input, are known to be <b>fragile</b>, and become permanently blocked after an agent traverses them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Package initial locations and time of appearance are specified in the input, as well as target locations and delivery deadline.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">There is also another type of agent, that also travels the graph, but does not pick up or deliver any packages. </span><span class="s2">Its only role is to block fragile edges by crossing them, and interfering.</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Both agents types can only do <b>traverse</b> and <b>no-op</b> actions. </span><span class="s2">Each action takes 1 time unit.</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The action always succeeds if the edge to be traversed is unblocked and there is no other agent at the destination; otherwise the action behaves the same as <b>no-op</b>. The simulation ends when all packages have been delivered, or there is no path for any agent to pick up or deliver any more packages on time.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The simulator should keep track of time, the number of actions done by each agent, and the total number packages successfully delivered by each agent. For simplicity, we assume in this assignment that agents take turns, each move advancing the clock by 1, and do not move concurently.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Implementation part I: simulator + simple agents</b></span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Initially you will implement the environment simulator, and several simple (non-AI) agents.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The environment simulator should start up by reading the problem instance specification from a file, in a format of your choice. We suggest the following format, using a simple ASCII file. For example (comments beginning with a semicolon):</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#X 4<span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>; Maximum x coordinate</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#Y 3<span class="Apple-converted-space">                </span>; Maximum y coordinate</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#P 4 0 0<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>D 0 3 50<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>; Package at (4,0) from time 0, deliver to (0,3) on or before time 50</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#P 0 3 5<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>D 4 0 50<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>; Package at (0,3) from time 5, deliver to (4,0) on or before time 50</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#B 3 0 4 0<span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>; Edge from (3,0) to (4,0) is always blocked</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#B 2 2 2 3<span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>; Edge from (2,2) to (2,3) is always blocked</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#F 0 0 0 1<span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>; Edge from (0,0) to (0,1) is fragile (can only be traversed once)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#A 0 0<span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>; Normal agent starts at (0,0)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#H 4 3<span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>; "Human" agent (see below)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>starts at (4,3)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">#I 1 1<span class="Apple-converted-space">              </span>; Interfering agent (see below) starts at (1,1)</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">As an initialization, the simulator should read the input file, and activate an agent program for each of the agents stated in the file.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">After the above initialization, the simulator should run each agent program in turn, </span><span class="s2">in the order they appear in the input file</span><span class="s1">, performing the actions retured by the agents, and update the world accordingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Additionally, </span><span class="s2">the simulator should be capable of displaying the state of the world after each step</span><span class="s1">, with the appropriate state of the agents and their score.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The score of an agent is the number of packages delivered on time by that agent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">A simple screen display in ASCII is sufficient (no bonuses for fancy graphics - this is not the point in this course!).</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Each agent program (a function) works as follows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The </span><span class="s2">agent is called by the simulator, together with a set of observations</span><span class="s1"> (can be a pointer to the state of the world as we have full observability in this assignment).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The agent returns a move to be carried out in the current world state.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The agent is allowed to keep an internal state (for example, a </span><span class="s2">computed optimal path</span><span class="s1">, or anything else desired) if needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To make this more like standard MAPD, here the agents move quasi-concurrently, <b>so need to check that they do not both use the same edge (in opposite directions) at the same time.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">An agent may move to a location that contained another agent if just before in the same time unit the other agent moved away from that location.</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>A single move by all agents takes 1 time unit.</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You should implement the following agents:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li10"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">A <b>human</b> agent, i.e. </span><span class="s2">print the state</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s2">read the next move from the user</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s2">and return it to the simulator.</span><span class="s1"> This is used for debugging and evaluating the program.</span></li>
  <li class="li10"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">A <b>stupid greedy</b> agent, that works as follows: if the agent is not holding a package, it should compute the shortest currently unblocked path to the next vertex with a package to be delivered, and try to follow it. If it is holding a package, it should find the shortest path to a delivery location for the package, and try to follow it. If holding more than 1 package, attempt to deliver the one with a shorter path to its delivery location. If there is no such path, do <b>no-op</b>. Here and elsewhere, if needed, break ties by prefering lower-numbered vertices in the x axis and then in the y axis. Stupidly ignores other agents.</span></li>
  <li class="li10"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">A <b>interfering</b> saboteur agent, that moves and tries to block fragile edges by traversing them. The saboteur works as follows:<b> it computes the shortest path to a fragile edge, and moves in that direction.</b> If not possible, it does a no-op. The saboteur does not pick up packages. Prefer the lowest-numbered vertices along the x axis and then the y axis in case of ties. Stupidly ignores other agents.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">At this stage, you should run the environment with up to <b>three</b> agents participating in each run: one stupid greedy agent, one saboteur agent, and one other agent (human or stupid greedy). Your program should display and record the scores. In particular, you should run the stupid greedy agent with various initial configurations. Also, test your environment with several agents in the same run, to see that it works correctly. You would be advised to do a good job here w.r.t. program extensibility, modularity, etc. much of this code may be used for some of the following assignments as well.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Clarification and rationale:</b> </span><span class="s2">Note that this part of the assignment will not really be checked</span><span class="s1">, as it contains no AI, so details are not important. The goal of this part of the assignment is constructing infrastructure for the rest of the assignment(s). E.g. the "human agent" is intended as a debugging and demo aid, and also towards assignment 2, and the</span><span class="s2"> stupid greedy agent contains code for shortest path that would be a component in a heuristic in the 2nd part of this assignment.</span></p>
<h3 style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 14.0px 0.0px; font: 20.0px Times; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000"><span class="s1"><b>Implementation part II: search agents</b></span></h3>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Now</b>, after chapter 4, you will be implementing intelligent agents (this is part 2 of the assignment) that need to act in this environment. Although the real MAPD problem is intended for multiple robots, and packages may appear at unknown times, in this assignment we only do a <b>single agent</b> search (but see bonus below if you wish) and assume that the environment is </span><span class="s2">deterministic and fully observable</span><span class="s1">. Each agent should assume that it is acting alone, regardless of whether it is true.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">You will be implementing a "search" agent as defined below. All the algorithms will use an <b>admissible heuristic evaluation function</b> either the basic one being an appropriately defined spanning tree heuristic discussed in the lecture, or a heuristic of your choice which dominates the basic heuristic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The search algorithms you implement should search for a path that minimizes the time to deliver all packages in the grid, subject to each package being delivered on or before its deadline.</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
  <li class="li10"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"><b>A greedy search agent</b>, that picks the move with </span><span class="s2">best immediate heuristic value to expand next</span><span class="s1">.</span></li>
  <li class="li10"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">An agent using <b>A* search, with the same heuristic</b>. Assume a global constant of LIMIT expansions (default 10000) beyond which we just return "fail", and the agent does just the "no-op" action.</span></li>
  <li class="li10"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1"><b>An agent using real-time A* doing L</b> (user determined constant, L=10 by default) expansions before each move decision.</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The performance measure will be based on the "situated planning and search" idea of goal achievement time, that is, recognizing that the search algorithm run also takes time! Rather than using a real-time clock, we will simply have a per-expansion time T, and if N expansions are run in the search algorithm this means that N*T time has passed in real time. The performance of an agent will thus be equal to S, when the path is actually executed in "real time". For simplicity, we will start with T=0, that is, assuming that search takes no time.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Note that if T is non-zero, a path that looks optimal may actually be bad because we have wasted a lot of time to find it, when a simple quickly found path may be almost as good.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The number of expansions are: </span><span class="s2">1 per action for the greedy agent (always 1 expansion)</span><span class="s1">, and</span><span class="s2"> L for the "real-time A*"</span><span class="s1">.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>We will run all algorithms with values of T being 0, 0.000001, and 0.01 and report the performance results.</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Observe that for "situated" A* this is a very hard problem for an algorithm that considers the deadline, as we do not know the number of expansions before we do the search! Many search applications just assume that the number of expansions is maximal and equal to LIMIT, or ignore the effect on the goal achievement time, but determining how to do this in a reasonable manner is an open research problem. (Do this to earn an MSc, or even a PhD.)</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Bonus version 1</b>: construct a search agent as above, but in addition allow one saboteur agent also acting in the environment. Your search agent needs to take this into account. Observe that although this seems to be a multi-agent problem, the fact that saboteur is perfectly predictable makes this in essence a single agent search problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Bonus version 2</b>: construct a search agent as above, but in addition allow one additional normal agent also acting in the environment. This is a move towards making this a <b>multi</b> agent pickup and delivery, as in the actual warehouse application. Your search agent needs to take this into account. Observe that although this seems to be a multi-agent problem, the fact that the other agent is perfectly predictable makes this in essence a single agent search problem. Here the agents move truly in parallel. Agents here are assumed to have centralized control, i.e. a single algorithm computes a path for both of them.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Addtional bonus - theoretical</b>: <b>What is the computational complexity of the MAPD Problem (single agent)? </b>Can you prove that it is NP-hard? Or is it in P? If the latter, can you design an algorithm that solves the problem in polynomial time?</span></p>
